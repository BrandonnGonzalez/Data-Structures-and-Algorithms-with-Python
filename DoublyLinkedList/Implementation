# You finished your DoublyLinkedList class! Now we’re going to use that class to model a subway line. A doubly linked list is a great data structure to use to model a subway, as both have a first and last element, and are comprised of nodes (or stops) 
# with links to the elements before and after them.

# We will add to and remove stops from our subway line, and print it out to see what we’ve done. The .stringify_list() method is the same as the one from the LinkedList class and has been provided for you.



# Create your subway line here:
# step 1 and 2
subway = DoublyLinkedList()
subway.add_to_head("Times Square")
subway.add_to_head("Grand Central")
subway.add_to_head("Central Park")
print(subway.stringify_list())

# step 3
subway.add_to_tail("Penn Station")
subway.add_to_tail("Wall Street")
subway.add_to_tail("Brooklyn Bridge")
print(subway.stringify_list())

# step 4
subway.remove_head()
subway.remove_tail()
print(subway.stringify_list())

# step 5
subway.remove_by_value("Times Square")
print(subway.stringify_list())
